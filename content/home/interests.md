* My main research interests include computer graphics, computer vision and machine learning. Specifically, I am focusing on content creation for 3D scenes/shapes and 2D visual media.
The goal of my research is to enable novice users to create *high quality* and *customized* content through intelligent algorithms and intuitive interfaces (such as examples, images and natural language).

* I am also highly interested in the direction of using computer graphics techniques (e.g., data synthesis) to boost computer vision tasks such as 2D/3D understanding, segmentation, as well as 3D reconstruction.

* For more detailed introduction about my research, please check of my recent talk given at JLU: [slides](files/20211006_jlu_intro_to_ai_ruima.pptx) (in Chinese).
