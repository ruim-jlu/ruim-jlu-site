* My main research interests include computer graphics, computer vision and artificial intelligence. Specifically, I am focusing on content creation for 3D scenes/shapes and 2D visual media.
The goal of my research is to enable novice users to create *high quality* and *customized* content through intelligent algorithms and intuitive interfaces (such as examples, images and natural language).

* I am also highly interested in the direction of using computer graphics techniques (e.g., data synthesis) to boost computer vision tasks such as 2D/3D understanding, segmentation, as well as 3D reconstruction.
