# Summary. An optional shortened abstract.
summary: We introduce RaidaR, a rich annotated image dataset of rainy street scenes, to support autonomous driving research. The new dataset contains the largest number of rainy images (58,542) to date, 5,000 of which provide semantic segmentations and 3,658 provide object instance segmentations.
